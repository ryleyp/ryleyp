This project is a simple implementation of a TCP client and server with knapsack encryption written in Python. To run this code, you must run the server file and then the client file. Once it is indicated that the server has made a proper connection, the client will prompt the user to input their first name, last name, major, username, and password. The password is then encrypted using Merkle-Hellman Knapsack encryption. This method encrypts every character of the password using a superincreasing array as the private key and a set modulus and multiplier. After the data is encrypted, it is stored in a JSON file.
